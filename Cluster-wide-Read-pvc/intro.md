# RBAC: Storage Viewer (PVCs & StorageClasses)

A new DevOps engineer, **sara.jones@example.com**, has joined the team. Your task is to grant her **cluster-wide read-only** access to:
- **PersistentVolumeClaims** (core API group)
- **StorageClasses** (`storage.k8s.io` API group)


Click **Start Scenario** to begin. The setup script will create a demo namespace and sample storage objects for you to test against.

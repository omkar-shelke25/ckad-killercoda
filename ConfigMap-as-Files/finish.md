# ðŸŽ‰ Success!

You created a **ConfigMap** with HTML files and mounted it into an **NGINX** Pod so that the files appeared under `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

## You accomplished
- âœ… Created `html-config` with `index.html` and `error.html`
- âœ… Created `web-pod` using `nginx:1.29.0`
- âœ… Mounted ConfigMap as files into NGINX web root
- âœ… Verified presence and contents inside the container

> Tip: Mounting ConfigMaps as files is perfect for shipping small static assets or config snippets without rebuilding images.

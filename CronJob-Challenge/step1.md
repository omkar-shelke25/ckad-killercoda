# CronJob Challenge

## ðŸ”¹ Question (Weightage: 4)

In the `batch` namespace, create a **CronJob** named `task-cron` with the following requirements:

* Schedule: run every 5 minutes
* Image: `busybox`
* Command:

  ```bash
  /bin/sh -c "echo Processing && sleep 30"
  ```
* The Job should **fail if it runs longer than 40 seconds**
* Limit retries to **2** before the Job is marked as failed
* Each Job run must complete **4 successful Pods**
* At most **2 Pods** should run in parallel
* Completed Jobs should be **automatically deleted 120 seconds** after finishing

      parallelism: 2                    # Run 2 Pods at a time
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 120      # Clean up Job 120s after finishing
      activeDeadlineSeconds: 40         # Fail Job if runs > 40 seconds
      template:

# âœ… Remediation Complete

You hardened the `busybox` Deployment in `net-acm`:

- Runs **as non-root**
- **allowPrivilegeEscalation: false**
- Added **NET_BIND_SERVICE** capability only
- Provided `/net-acm/id.sh` to prove the podâ€™s UID for audits

This is a realistic baseline youâ€™ll apply across many workloads in production. ðŸ”’

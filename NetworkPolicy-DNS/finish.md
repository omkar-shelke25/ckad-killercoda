# Congratulations!

You enforced a strict default-deny posture for a sensitive Pod while allowing only the minimal egress needed for **DNS**.

## What you accomplished:

✅ Created a NetworkPolicy named `deny-all-except-dns` in `netpol-demo2`  
✅ Targeted only the `isolated` Pod via `podSelector` (`app=isolated`)  
✅ Denied **all ingress** and **all egress** by default  
✅ Allowed **only** DNS egress (UDP/53) to any destination

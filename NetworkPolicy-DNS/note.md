| **1. Ingress only, no rules**               | `Ingress`                      | `ingress: []` or omitted    | **All ingress denied** (pods cannot receive any traffic)            |
| **2. Ingress only, allow rules**            | `Ingress`                      | `ingress:` with rules       | **Ingress restricted to matching rules** (all other ingress denied) |

| **7. Ingress + Egress, no rules**           | `Ingress, Egress`              | both omitted or `[]`        | **All ingress denied + all egress denied**                          |
| **8. Ingress + Egress, rules only for one** | `Ingress, Egress`              | e.g. only `egress:` defined | **Ingress denied (since listed but no rules) + Egress restricted**  |

### âœ… Summary (easy way to remember)

* If a direction (`Ingress` or `Egress`) is **not listed in `policyTypes` â†’ all traffic in that direction is ALLOWED**.
* If it **is listed but has no rules â†’ all traffic in that direction is DENIED**.
* If it **is listed with rules â†’ only traffic matching rules is ALLOWED**, rest is DENIED.

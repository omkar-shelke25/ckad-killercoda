# 🎉 Congratulations!

You identified the RBAC misconfiguration and fixed it **in-place**.

## You accomplished:
- 🔎 Investigated a failing permission for SA `dev-user-1` in `project-alpha`
- 🛠️ Found the Role rule used **singular** `configmap` instead of **plural** `configmaps`
- ✏️ Edited/patched the live Role (no delete/recreate)
- ✅ Verified `dev-user-1` can list ConfigMaps in the namespace

Pro tip: Use `kubectl api-resources` to confirm the correct resource names (they are plural in Role rules).

**RBAC Misconfiguration Challenge**

A developer, represented by the ServiceAccount **`dev-user-1`**, cannot list ConfigMaps in the **`project-alpha`** namespace. A **Role** and **RoleBinding** already exist but something is off.

**Your Objective**
- Inspect the existing Role and RoleBinding.
- Identify and fix the misconfiguration **in-place** (do not delete/recreate).
- Verify that `dev-user-1` can now list ConfigMaps in `project-alpha`.

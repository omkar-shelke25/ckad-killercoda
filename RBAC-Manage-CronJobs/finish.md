# ðŸŽ‰ All set!

You granted **CronJob-only** management permissions to the data science team's ServiceAccount in the `batch-processing` namespace.

## You accomplished
- âœ… Created ServiceAccount **cron-manager-sa**
- âœ… Created Role **cronjob-lifecycle-role** with full lifecycle verbs on **cronjobs** (API group `batch`)
- âœ… Bound it via RoleBinding **bind-cron-manager**
- âœ… Verified access: **can** create `CronJobs`, **cannot** create `Pods`

> Tip: Keep Roles tightly scoped to just the resources and verbs needed.

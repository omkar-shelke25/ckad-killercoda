# ðŸŽ‰ Well done!

You deployed Nginx to serve on port 80 **without root**, granting only the **NET_BIND_SERVICE** capability.

## You accomplished:
- âœ… 2 replicas of `nginx:1.25-alpine`
- âœ… Secure port binding on 80 via capabilities
- âœ… `runAsUser: 101`, `runAsNonRoot: true`
- âœ… `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- âœ… Pods reached **Ready** state

Great job applying least-privilege security to real-world workloads! ðŸš€

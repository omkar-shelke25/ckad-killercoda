# ✅ Completed

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You successfully created a **sidecar container** for logging! 

### What You Accomplished:

1. ✓ **Examined** the existing `cleaner` Deployment in namespace `mercury`
2. ✓ **Added** a sidecar container named `logger-con` using the busybox image
3. ✓ **Configured** the sidecar as an initContainer with `restartPolicy: Always`
4. ✓ **Shared** the logs volume between both containers
5. ✓ **Implemented** log streaming using `tail -f /var/log/cleaner.log`
6. ✓ **Saved** your changes to `/opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml`
7. ✓ **Applied** the updated Deployment
8. ✓ **Verified** logs are accessible via `kubectl logs`

Great work! This pattern is commonly tested in CKAD exams and widely used in production Kubernetes clusters.

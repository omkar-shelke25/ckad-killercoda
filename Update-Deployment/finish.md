You successfully updated the **gamma-app** Deployment in-place by:
- Changing the **container image** from `nginx:latest` â†’ `nginx:stable`
- Renaming the **container** from `nginx` â†’ `gamma-nginx`
- Ensuring the **Deployment UID remained unchanged** (not recreated)

## Key Takeaways

âœ… **In-place updates**: You can modify Deployments without deleting them using `kubectl edit`, `kubectl patch`, or `kubectl set image` followed by `kubectl edit`.

âœ… **Deployment UID**: The UID is a unique identifier that remains constant throughout the Deployment's lifecycle. If it changes, the object was deleted and recreated.

âœ… **Container name changes**: While `kubectl set image` can update images, changing container names requires editing the Deployment spec directly.

This mirrors real operations where you need to update production workloads safely without disrupting the resource identity and configuration management.

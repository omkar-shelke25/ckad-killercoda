## âœ… Task Completed Successfully

You have successfully configured pod communication using existing NetworkPolicies! 

### ðŸŽ¯ What You Accomplished

- **Analyzed existing NetworkPolicies** without modifying them
- **Identified the correct labels** needed for pod communication
- **Applied the proper labels** to enable bidirectional communication
- **Ensured** pod `ckad-netpol-newpod` can only communicate with `web` and `db` pods

Great job mastering this challenging NetworkPolicy scenario! ðŸŒŸ

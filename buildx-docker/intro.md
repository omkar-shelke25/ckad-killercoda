# 🛠️ Buildx Image Export Lab

In this lab you will learn how to use **Docker Buildx** to build container images and export them in two formats:

- 📦 **Docker archive** (`docker save` style)  
- 📂 **OCI archive** (industry standard layout)

⚡ Note: The environment will install the buildx plugin during setup.  
👉 Please **WAIT 2–3 minutes** for it to finish before starting your build.

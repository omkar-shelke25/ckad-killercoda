# 🎉 Scenario Complete

Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured `app-pod` in the `ckad-netpol` namespace to comply with the existing NetworkPolicy.

## ✅ What You Did
- 🔍 Inspected the NetworkPolicy to understand its restrictions.
- ✏️ Modified `app-pod` by adding the `role: allowed-app` label.
- 🔌 Verified connectivity from `frontend-pod` to `app-pod` and from `app-pod` to `backend-pod`.
- 🛡️ Ensured `app-pod` remained running.
- 🧪 Passed the verification script.

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- NetworkPolicies in Kubernetes control pod traffic using labels and selectors.
- The `podSelector` in a NetworkPolicy targets pods by their labels (e.g., `role: allowed-app`).
- Use `kubectl edit` or `kubectl label` to modify pod labels without recreating the pod.

Feel free to explore more CKAD scenarios or revisit this one to practice further! 🚀

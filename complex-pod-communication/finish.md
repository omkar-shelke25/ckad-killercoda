# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You successfully completed the CKAD NetworkPolicy challenge!

## What you accomplished:

âœ… **Analyzed existing NetworkPolicies** to understand their label selectors  
âœ… **Applied correct labels** to pods without modifying any NetworkPolicy  
âœ… **Configured network isolation** so that `target-pod` can only communicate with `frontend-pod` and `backend-pod`  
âœ… **Maintained policy integrity** by working within the constraints  


ðŸš€ **This demonstrates intermediate-level CKAD skills in Kubernetes networking and security!**

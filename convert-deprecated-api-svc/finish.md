# âœ… Completed

You converted the deprecated Deployment manifest, fixed the missing selector, applied it into the `interstellar` namespace, mounted the provided HTML using a ConfigMap, and exposed the application via a NodePort Service `gargantuan-svc` on port **33000**. All pods are running and the HTML file is available inside the pod.

Well done!

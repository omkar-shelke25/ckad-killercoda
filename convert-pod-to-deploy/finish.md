# ðŸŽ‰ Completed

You converted the single **Pod** into a **Deployment** with **3 replicas** in the **pluto** namespace, added container-level security
(`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `privileged: false`), deleted the original Pod, and saved the Deployment manifest to:

`/opt/course/9/holy-api-deployment.yaml`

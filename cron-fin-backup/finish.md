You created a CronJob named **db-backup** in the `payment` namespace with:

- Schedule every 10 minutes  
- Restart policy set to **OnFailure**  
- History limits (3 successful, 1 failed)  
- Deadline tolerance (100 seconds)  

You also triggered a one-time backup Job named **manual-db-backup** from this CronJob.  

This simulates both **scheduled automation** and **on-demand execution**, just like in real-world finance workloads. ðŸš€

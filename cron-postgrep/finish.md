# ðŸŽ‰ Completed

You successfully created a **real-life CronJob** for PostgreSQL backups:

- Runs daily at 3:00 AM  
- No overlapping runs (Forbid)  
- Runs within 2 minutes if missed  
- Pods never restart automatically  
- Keeps 3 successful and 1 failed history jobs  

You also validated it by triggering a manual backup Job and checking its logs.  
This simulates a real-world **SRE task for database backup automation**.

Great work!

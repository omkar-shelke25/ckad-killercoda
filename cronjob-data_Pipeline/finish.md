# ðŸŽ‰ Nice work!

You created a **production-like CronJob** with:
- A frequent schedule (every 10 minutes) and **no overlaps**
- Tight **history limits** (2 successes, 1 failure)
- Job controls: **3 retries**, **2 completions**, **1 parallel**, **TTL=90s**, **deadline=50s**
- A simple **busybox** workload that simulates ETL and **never restarts**

This mirrors a common data engineering pattern where **throughput, correctness, and cluster hygiene** all matter. ðŸš€

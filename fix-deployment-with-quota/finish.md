# ðŸŽ‰ Completed â€” Production-style ResourceQuota fix

You successfully:

- Inspected the **ResourceQuota** `rq-payments-prod` in namespace `payments-prod`.
- Identified the cause: the `checkout-api` Deployment had **no** resource requests/limits while the quota requires `requests.*` and `limits.*`.
- Updated the `checkout-api` Deployment Pod template to include production-appropriate `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` that fit within the namespace quota (example: `requests: cpu=200m,memory=512Mi` per replica).
- Verified that Pods are now being created and at least one Pod is `Running`.

This models a common production failure: admission/quotas preventing workloads that don't declare resources. In production, always coordinate quotas and per-pod resource planning â€” and prefer ResourceQuota + LimitRange + namespace resource planning for predictability.

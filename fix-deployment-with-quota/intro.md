# CKAD: ResourceQuota and Deployment Resource Requests

A namespace has a **ResourceQuota** that enforces limits on CPU and Memory.

A Deployment exists in this namespace, but its Pod is not being created because the Pod spec does not define resource requests/limits.

Your task is to analyze the ResourceQuota, fix the Deployment, and ensure Pods run successfully.

Click **Start Scenario** to begin.

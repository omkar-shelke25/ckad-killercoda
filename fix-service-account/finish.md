# ðŸŽ‰ Well done!

You fixed the **payment-api** deployment so its pods now run with the **payment-sa** ServiceAccount.  

This ensures the app has the right RBAC permissions (via the Role **secret-accessor** and RoleBinding **payment-secret-binding**) to securely access sensitive payment secrets.  

Great work! ðŸš€

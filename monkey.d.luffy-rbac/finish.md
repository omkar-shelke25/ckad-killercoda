# 🎉 Completed

You successfully configured RBAC for **both** deployments in the **one-piece** namespace!

## What You Accomplished

### Part 1: monkey.d.luffy Deployment
1. ✅ Created ServiceAccount **thousand-sunny**
2. ✅ Created Role **strawhat-role** with `get`, `list`, and `watch` permissions
3. ✅ Created RoleBinding **strawhat-rb** to bind the Role to the ServiceAccount
4. ✅ Updated Deployment **monkey.d.luffy** to use the ServiceAccount

### Part 2: crew-monitor Deployment
5. ✅ Created Role **navigator-role** with deployment permissions
6. ✅ Created RoleBinding **navigator-rb** to bind the Role to **nami-navigator** ServiceAccount
7. ✅ Verified the deployment now has proper RBAC permissions

## 🛡️ RBAC Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant permissions that are actually needed
2. **Use ServiceAccounts**: Never use the `default` ServiceAccount for applications
3. **Namespace Isolation**: Use Roles instead of ClusterRoles when possible
4. **Audit Regularly**: Review who has access to what
5. **Document Permissions**: Clearly document why each permission is needed

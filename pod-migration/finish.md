# ðŸŽ‰ Completed!

You migrated the single out-of-place pod to the correct namespace without disrupting healthy workloads.

## You accomplished
- âœ… Left five Pods in `prime` unchanged and Running
- âœ… Removed the `mars-container` from `prime`
- âœ… Ensured one Pod with container `mars-container` is Running in `mars`

This mirrors a real on-call task: precise, low-risk remediation without collateral impact.

You successfully:

- Ensured Pod **ckad00018-newpod** only communicates with **web** and **db**  
- Applied the right labels (`app=web`, `app=db`, `app=newpod`)  
- Verified the existing NetworkPolicy enforces both Ingress and Egress restrictions  

This tests intermediate CKAD skills: **inspecting existing policies and adjusting resources without modifying the NetworkPolicy**.

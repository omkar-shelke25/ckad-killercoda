You created **pod6** in the **default** namespace with:
- Image `busybox:1.31.0`
- A **readinessProbe** (`cat /tmp/ready`) with `initialDelaySeconds: 5` and `periodSeconds: 10`
- A start command that **creates the probe file** and idles:
  - `touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d`

This pattern is common for apps that become ready only after a specific file or condition exists.
